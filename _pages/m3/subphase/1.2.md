bestPractice:
  - Establish the necessary PMO structure, staff and processes upfront as it will set the stage for the remainder of the migration
  - Maintain the same key personnel throughout the program
  - Develop Program Charter with a defined scope upfront based on the agreed upon vision; the Initial Schedule should be flexible and closely monitored for necessary updates
  - Develop IV&V Plan to independently and proactively identify risks
  - Establish a shared vision with a sense of urgency based on data
  - Clearly articulate goals and objectives that capture the "why" of the change and a high level statement of future activities
  - Ensure adequate scheduling and accounting for each step of the plan
