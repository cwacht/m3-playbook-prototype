# This file provides information that is used on multiple pages
# It is intended to reduce the amount of duplication across files

# activities-v2
# Allows removal of:
#   activities list in phase files
#   responsibleParty, and category in activity files
#
# Will need more logic for category loops on phase page

# activities-v3
# Allows simple category loops on phase page
#
# Will need more logic to find prev,next,current on activity page
# and its hard to tell which category

# activities-v4
# Allows simple category loops and simpl prev,next
#
# But the anchors are crazy and its hard to tell which category

# activities-v5
# Simple, foolproof
#
# Slightly more logic for category loops on phase page
